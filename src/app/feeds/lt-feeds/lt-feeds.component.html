        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: smaller;font-family: sans-serif;"> The Dark Night None of This Matters - The people who are the best at conversations know that none of this actually matters. If you mess up and say something awkward, no one will care. If someone cares, it doesn’t matter because there are billions
            of other people you can spend your time talking to. Don’t let your brain deceive you into thinking you cannot make a mistake. Always Know That You Can Walk Away - If you say something weird and the conversation dies, just know that you can
            always walk away. If it’s a stranger in public you don’t even have to say bye. There is power in knowing that you can retreat from a conversation at anytime. Talk Loud at First to Shut off Your Brain - This tricks your brain into thinking
            that you are in a safe environment and it will make it easier for you to be yourself. Talk to a Wall - Put on a timer for two minutes and talk to the wall about anything. Tell a story from the day, talk about the weather. Practice modulating
            your voice while you talk to make your story more captivating. This will help you speak with confidence when the other person isn’t investing into the conversation.
